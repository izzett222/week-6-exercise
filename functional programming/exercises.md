7. Collect the final names into a `List<String>` studentNames
8. display studentNames

# Exercise 2: Product Inventory Processing
You are given a list of products in an online store. Each product has:
- a name
- a category
- a price
- a stock quantity
Your goal is to generate a list of premium products that are currently available.

### Given data
```java
List<Product> products = List.of(

	new Product("Mouse", "Electronics", 25, 50),  
	new Product("Desk", "Furniture", 300, 0),  
	new Product("Phone", "Electronics", 800, 12),  
	new Product("Chair", "Furniture", 150, 7),

	new Product("Notebook", "Stationery", 10, 100)  
);
```

### Task
1. Keep only products that are in stock
2. Keep only products from the `"Electronics"` category
3. Keep only products with a price greater than `300`
4. Sort the products by price from lowest to highest
5. Convert the products into strings using this format:

```
PRODUCT_NAME -> $PRICE
```

Example:

```
Laptop -> $1200.0
```

6. Collect the final result into a `List<String>` result
7. print the result

# Exercise 3:  Movie Recommendation Processing
You are building a simple movie recommendation feature. Each movie has:
- a title
- a genre
- a rating
- a release year
Your goal is to generate a list of highly rated recent movies.

4. Transform each movie into this format:

```
TITLE (YEAR) - RATING
```

Example:

```
Dune (2021) - 8.1
```

5. Collect the final result into a `List<String>` result
6. print result

# Exercise 4: Course Enrollment Analysis
You are given a list of students enrolled in an online course platform. Each student has:
- a name
- a course
- a completion percentage
Your task is to analyze the data

### Given Data

	new Student("Alice", "Java", 100),
	new Student("Bob", "Java", 75),
	new Student("Charlie", "Python", 40),
	new Student("David", "Java", 90),
	new Student("Emma", "Python", 100),
	new Student("Frank", "JavaScript", 20)
);
```

### Tasks
- Count how many students:
	- are enrolled in the `"Java"` course
	- have completed the course (`progress == 100`)
- Check if:
	- At least one student has `0%` progress
	- All students have progress greater than `10`
	- No student has progress below `0`
	- Store each result in a boolean variable.
- Find:
	- The first student who completed a course
	- Any student enrolled in `"Python"`
	- Store results in `Optional<Student>` variables.
- Print the result of the operations above

# Exercise 5: Sales Report
You are given a list of customer orders from an online store. Each order has:
- a customer name
- a total amount
- a payment status
Your goal is to generate sales statistics

### Given data
